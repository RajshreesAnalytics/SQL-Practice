# SQL Practice — 30 Days
This repository contains my daily SQL practice.
Each file includes:
- A simple problem
- The SQL query I wrote
- A short explanation
I practice topics like:
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- GROUP BY, HAVING
- Joins (INNER, LEFT)
- Subqueries
- Window functions
- CTEs
My goal is to build strong SQL fundamentals by learning daily.
